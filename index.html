			<h1>Early Life</h1>

		<div class="p">
			<p>Hello I am Jonathan Campbell from Brooklyn, NY. I was born in Kings County Hospital on July 10, 1998, at 7:10a.m. I was born with Sickle Cell Disease which is a blood disease. My school life was hard at a young age, I was a smart child but Sickle Cell made it hard to keep up with other kids. When I was in seventh grade my mother was told by doctors that I was in no condition to go to school. This struck me hard because I lived across the street from my school. But even walking there was enough to put me in the hospital for days. I am very lucky to have a amazing mother who had started homeschooling me from grades seventh to twelfth. I am a video gamer who been playing since I was little. I was lucky to find the greater good in being home school, which was amazing to me. The only downfall to being home school was having few friends which was the case when I was in school. I gained amazing friends online and we still carry a friendship even till today. My childhood was still amazing!</p>

			<h1>Recent Life</h1>

		<div>
			<p class="p">My life has been pretty hard down the years, but I always survive. I am now sickle cell well and doing much better thanks to chemotherapy and great doctors. I decided to put my goal of professional gaming on hold to explore other careers. I am currently learning at Innovation Labs in Industry City for web design and coding. It brings me pleasure to say that I am happy with my life and look forward to what it holds next. </p>
